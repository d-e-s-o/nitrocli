Installation
------------

In addition to Rust itself and Cargo, its package management tool, the
following dependencies are required:
- **hidapi**: In order to provide USB access this library is used.
- **GnuPG**: The `gpg-connect-agent` program allows the user to enter
             PINs.

#### Via Packages
Packages are available for:
- Arch Linux: [`nitrocli`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nitrocli/) in the
  Arch User Repository
- Gentoo Linux: [`app-crypt/nitrocli`](https://github.com/d-e-s-o/nitrocli-ebuild)
  ebuild

#### From Crates.io
**nitrocli** is [published][nitrocli-cratesio] on crates.io and can
directly be installed from there:
```bash
$ cargo install nitrocli --root=$PWD/nitrocli
```

#### From Source
After cloning the repository and changing into the `nitrocli` subfolder,
the build is as simple as running:
```bash
