# nitrokey-rs

A libnitrokey wrapper for Rust providing access to Nitrokey devices.

[Documentation][]

## Compatibility

The required [`libnitrokey`][] version is built from source.  The host system
must provide `libhidapi-libusb0` (Linux) or `libhidapi` (non-Linux) in the
default library search path.  Depending on your system, you might also have to
install the [Nitrokey udev rules][].

Currently, this crate provides access to the common features of the Nitrokey
Pro and the Nitrokey Storage:  general configuration, OTP generation and the
password safe.  Basic support for the secure storage on the Nitrokey Storage is
available but still under development.

### Unsupported Functions

The following functions provided by `libnitrokey` are deliberately not
supported by `nitrokey-rs`:

- `NK_get_time()`.  This method is useless as it will always cause a timestamp
  error on the device (see [pull request #114][] for `libnitrokey` for details).
- `NK_get_status()`.  This method only provides a string representation of
  data that can be accessed by other methods (firmware version, serial number,
  configuration).
- `NK_get_status_storage_as_string()`.  This method only provides an incomplete
  string representation of the data returned by `NK_get_status_storage`.

## Tests

This crate has tests for different scenarios:  Some tests require that no
Nitrokey device is connected, others require a Nitrokey Storage or a Nitrokey
Pro.  We use the [`nitrokey-test`][] crate to select the test cases.  You can
just run `cargo test` to auto-detect connected Nitrokey devices and to run the
appropriate tests.  If you want to manually select the tests, set the
`NITROKEY_TEST_GROUP` environment variable to `nodev` (no device connected),
`pro` (Nitrokey Pro connected) or `storage` (Nitrokey Storage connected).

Note that the tests assume that the deviceâ€™s passwords are the factory defaults
(admin PIN `12345678`, user PIN `123456`, update password `12345678`) and that
an AES key has been built.  Some tests will overwrite the data stored on the
Nitrokey device or perform a factory reset.  Never execute the tests if you
unless yout want to destroy all data on all connected Nitrokey devices!

The `totp_no_pin` and `totp_pin` tests can occasionally fail due to bad timing.
