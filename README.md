nitrocli
========

- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

**nitrocli** is a program that provides a command line interface for
interaction with [Nitrokey Pro][nitrokey-pro] and [Nitrokey
Storage][nitrokey-storage] devices.


The following commands are currently supported:
- list: List all attached Nitrokey devices.
- status: Report status information about the Nitrokey.
- lock: Lock the Nitrokey.
- config: Access the Nitrokey's configuration
  - get: Read the current configuration.
  - set: Change the configuration.
- encrypted: Work with the Nitrokey Storage's encrypted volume.
  - open: Open the encrypted volume. The user PIN needs to be entered.
  - close: Close the encrypted volume.
- hidden: Work with the Nitrokey Storage's hidden volume.
  - create: Create a hidden volume.
  - open: Open a hidden volume with a password.
  - close: Close a hidden volume.
- otp: Access one-time passwords (OTP).
  - get: Generate a one-time password.
  - set: Set an OTP slot.
  - status: List all OTP slots.
  - clear: Delete an OTP slot.
- pin: Manage the Nitrokey's PINs.
  - clear: Remove the user and admin PIN from gpg-agent's cache.
  - set: Change the admin or the user PIN.
  - unblock: Unblock and reset the user PIN.
- pws: Access the password safe (PWS).
  - get: Query the data on a PWS slot.
  - set: Set the data on a PWS slot.
  - status: List all PWS slots.
  - clear: Delete a PWS slot.
- unencrypted: Work with the Nitrokey Storage's unencrypted volume.
  - set: Change the read-write mode of the unencrypted volume.


Usage
-----

Usage is as simple as providing the name of the respective command as a
parameter (note that some commands are organized through subcommands,
which are required as well), e.g.:
```bash
# Open the nitrokey's encrypted volume.
$ nitrocli storage open

$ nitrocli status
Status:
  model:             Storage
  serial number:     0x00053141
  firmware version:  0.47
  user retry count:  3
  admin retry count: 3
  Storage:
    SD card ID:        0x05dcad1d
    firmware:          unlocked
    storage keys:      created
    volumes:
      unencrypted:     active
      encrypted:       active
      hidden:          inactive

# Close it again.
$ nitrocli storage close
```

More examples, a more detailed explanation of the purpose, the potential
subcommands, as well as the parameters of each command are provided in
the [`man` page](doc/nitrocli.1.pdf).


Installation
------------

In addition to Rust itself and Cargo, its package management tool, the
following dependencies are required:
- **hidapi**: In order to provide USB access this library is used.
- **GnuPG**: The `gpg-connect-agent` program allows the user to enter
             PINs.

#### Via Packages
Packages are available for:
- Arch Linux: [`nitrocli`][nitrocli-arch] in the Arch User Repository
- Debian: [`nitrocli`][nitrocli-debian] (since Debian Buster)
- Gentoo Linux: [`app-crypt/nitrocli`][nitrocli-gentoo] ebuild
- Ubuntu: [`nitrocli`][nitrocli-ubuntu] (since Ubuntu 19.04)

#### From Crates.io
**nitrocli** is [published][nitrocli-cratesio] on crates.io and can
directly be installed from there:
```bash
$ cargo install nitrocli --root=$PWD/nitrocli
```

#### From Source
After cloning the repository the build is as simple as running:
```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

It is recommended that the resulting executable be installed in a
directory accessible via the `PATH` environment variable.


#### Bash Completion
**nitrocli** comes with Bash completion support for options and
arguments to them. A completion script can be generated via the
`shell-complete` utility program and then only needs to be sourced to
make the current shell provide context-sensitive tab completion support.
```bash
$ cargo run --bin=shell-complete > nitrocli.bash
$ source nitrocli.bash
```

The generated completion script can be installed system-wide as usual
and sourced through Bash initialization files, such as `~/.bashrc`.


Known Problems
--------------

- Due to a problem with the default `hidapi` version on macOS, users are
  advised to build and install [`libnitrokey`][] from source and then
  set the `USE_SYSTEM_LIBNITROKEY` environment variable when building
  `nitrocli` using one of the methods described above.
- `nitrocli` cannot connect to a Nitrokey device that is currently being
  accessed by `nitrokey-app` ([upstream issue][libnitrokey#32]). To
  prevent this problem, quit `nitrokey-app` before using `nitrocli`.
- Applications using the Nitrokey device (such as `nitrocli` or
  `nitrokey-app`) cannot easily share access with an instance of GnuPG
  running shortly afterwards ([upstream issue][libnitrokey#137]).
